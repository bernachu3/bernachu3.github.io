  <h2> ‚öΩ What do I hope to accomplish in ITB? </h2>
  <p> Throughout this course, I hope to be able to learn critical info relating to Information Technology (IT),
      such as how to program, develop, deploy, and maintain applications and websites,
      diagnose and troubleshoot issues that may arise, and obtain good coding practices such as formatting and sanitisation.
      I also hope to be able to learn various programming languages and understand which solution is best for issues at hand. </p>

  <h2> ‚úèÔ∏è What have I learned? </h2>
  <p> I found that the easiest way for me to learn programming and absorb information is to have an issue that I wish to solve,
      as learning about what Python is able to do is not very useful without having a real-world situation to apply it to. </p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>
      are very valuable websites to get solutions. </p>
  <p> Version control and backups are important not only because you might lose your data, but because you might do hours of work only to realise
      it didn't solve your problem and you wish to delete everything start over. </p>
  <p> Encrypt EVERYTHING. </p>
  <p> The biggest threats to privacy are not individuals, but instead overly nosy companies and organisations. </p>
  
  <h2> üß† What did I find challenging? </h2>
  <p> I find the most challenging thing about programming is that there is a lot of troubleshooting involved, and because
      a single incorrect syntax or typo can completely break the whole thing, it is quite hard to figure out which line out of
      hundreds of lines of code is causing issue. </p>
  
  <h2> üí≠ Other Thoughts </h2>
  <p> HTML and CSS is pretty straightforward to understand. </p>
  <p> On the other hand, Python's built-in error handling is vague, the language unclear and I find not very useful.
      The best way to learn Python, it seems, is to have a goal that you wish to work towards, or 'dive in' as the saying goes.
      Reading through documentation usually is not productive.</p>
  <p> SQL seems a powerful tool for how simple it is to get into, although keeping track of thousands of entries seems rather daunting. </p>
