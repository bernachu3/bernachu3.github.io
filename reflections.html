  <h2> ‚öΩ What do I hope to accomplish in ITB? </h2>
  <p> Throughout this course, I hope to be able to learn critical info relating to Information Technology (IT),
      such as how to program, develop, deploy, and maintain applications and websites,
      diagnose and troubleshoot issues that may arise, and obtain good coding practices such as formatting and sanitisation.
      I also hope to be able to learn various programming languages and understand which solution is best for issues at hand. </p>

  <h2> ‚úèÔ∏è What have I learned? </h2>
  <p> I found that the easiest way for me to learn programming and absorb information is to have an issue that I wish to solve,
      as learning about what Python is able to do is not very useful without having a real-world situation to apply it to. </p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>
      are very valuable websites to get solutions. </p>
  <p> Version control and backups are important not only because you might lose your data, but because you might do hours of work only to realise
      it didn't solve your problem and you wish to delete everything start over. </p>
  <p> Encryption isn't just to keep private date safe from prying eyes, it's also important to guarantee the data has not been modified by a malicious
      third party. </p>
  <p> The biggest threats to privacy are not individuals, but instead overly nosy companies and organisations. </p>
  
  <h2> üß† What did I find challenging? </h2>
  <p> I find the most challenging thing about programming is that there is a lot of troubleshooting involved, and because
      a single incorrect syntax or typo can completely break the whole thing, it is quite hard to figure out which line out of
      hundreds of lines of code is causing issue. </p>
  
  <h2> üí≠ Other Thoughts </h2>
  Seems like there are a <i>lot</i> of programming languages that one must be familiar with in web development.
  
    <h3> HTML and CSS <h3>
    <p> Pretty straightforward to understand; almost in plain English. </p>
    
    <h3> Python </h3>
    <p> The best way to learn Python, it seems, is to have a goal that you wish to work towards, or 'dive in' as the saying goes.
        Reading through documentation usually is not productive. </p>
    <p> Python's built-in error handling is vague, the language unclear and I find not very useful. </p>
    <p> There are a bunch of challenges on the Web such as attempting to print 1 to 100 without typing in any numbers or using loops.
        I don't know how anyone manages to come up with something that satisfies the requirement within 20 lines of code. </p>
      
    <h3> SQL </h3>
    <p> SQL looks a powerful tool for how simple it is to get into and I should definitely learn more about it,
        although keeping track of thousands of entries seems rather daunting. </p>
    <p> The possibility of accidentally destroying your entire database because of one typo seems like an oversight. </p>
      
    <h3> JSON </h3>
    <p> It seems a lot of sites on the Web use JSON, and I should also schedule time to get into it. </p>
