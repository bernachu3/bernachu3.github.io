  <h2> ðŸ’¼ How is my course is helping me prepare for a career in IT? </h2>
  <p> With Python, HTML, CSS and SQL, I believe this would cover the majority of programming that one needs to know in most IT jobs. <p>
  <p> Most likely, whatever career path I decide to enter I could get by with these four languages. </p>
  <p> I am also learning about meta stuff, such as good programming practices, what is good code and different programming paradigms. </p>
  
  <h2> âš½ What do I hope to accomplish in ITB? </h2>
  <p> Throughout this course, I hope to be able to learn critical info relating to Information Technology (IT),
      such as how to program, develop, deploy, and maintain applications and websites,
      diagnose and troubleshoot issues that may arise, and obtain good coding practices such as formatting and sanitisation.
      I also hope to be able to learn various programming languages and understand which solution is best for issues at hand. </p>
  
  <h2> ðŸ’ª Have I accomplished my goals? </h2>
  <p> I've learned a lot about Python and can now say that I am reasonably versed in using it. </p>
  <p> I can say that I have reached the point where I have most commands memorised and don't need to look them up. </p>
  <p> I've also learned HTML, CSS and SQL syntax. </p>
  
  <h2> ðŸ§  What did I find challenging? </h2>
  <p> I find the most challenging thing about programming is that there is a lot of troubleshooting involved, and because
      a single incorrect syntax or typo can completely break the whole thing, it is quite hard to figure out which line out of
      hundreds of lines of code is causing issue. </p>
    
  <h2> ðŸ”¨ Places to improve </h2>
  <p> With Python's strict syntax I also find it quite difficult to, from a piece of plaintext, figure out whether the code is valid. 
      Eclipse and Google Colab both helpfully colour code things like comments and commands, and even if that fails I usually debug
      via running the program and seeing what errors it throws up. </p>
  <p> I don't think this is of major concern since there would be very low chance I need to analyse and debug code in such a way,
      but it's likely a skill that won't hurt me. </p>
  <p> So far I have not done much in the field of code optimisation, and while the small programs I write today are light enough that
      this is not an issue even on the most lowest specced of computers, if I were to continue down this path I should begin to put in time
      in the debugging and testing stages to study code run length and optimise so they do not take up as much time or resources
      when the need becomes necessary. </p>
